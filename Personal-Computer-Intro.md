## 📚 **1. Understanding AI** 🤔

### **What is AI?** 🤖 
**AI = Machines that Think! 💡**  
AI is when computers learn and make decisions like humans. You already use AI every day! 

- 🎙️ **Voice Assistants** (e.g., Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant for hands-free help)    
- 🎭 **AI-Generated Art & Text** (e.g., chatbots and social media content creation)     
- 📸 **Photo Filters** (e.g., fun effects on Snapchat and Instagram)    
- 🎥 **Movie & Music Recommendations** (e.g., personalized suggestions on Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify)     

💡 **Quick Thought:** Where else do you see AI? Jot down your ideas!🤔💭

## 🖥️ **3. Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks**
### **What is a Jupyter Notebook? 📒**  
A Jupyter Notebook is like a smart digital notebook where you can write and run Python code in small sections (cells). Think of it as typing notes and instantly running experiments on a computer! 📝💡  

🔹 **Jupyter = Digital Lab Notebook for AI & Coding!** 🚀

### Open Google Colab
1️⃣ Open your browser and go to  **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**.  
2️⃣ Click **+ New notebook**.

##  🐍 4. Your First Python Code (Step-by-Step) 🚀

### 🔹 Print a Message 📢 
### **➕🐍 Add a New Code Cell**                              
1️⃣ Click **+ Code** in the top left to add a new code cell.        
2️⃣ Copy and paste the following into the new code cell.     
     
🔗 [ChatGPT explanation for the code](https://chatgpt.com/share/67d0e013-a50c-800b-9a61-0f0db5dbbc8f)
```python
# The print function outputs the message to the screen
print("Hello AI World!")  
```
3️⃣ Click **Run** (▶) and check the output!   

✅ If done correctly, you should see: `Hello AI World!` printed below the cell.

---

### 🔹 Do Basic Math ➕➖
### **➕🐍 Add a New Code Cell**  
1️⃣ Click **+ Code** to add another code cell.  
2️⃣ Copy and paste the following code into the new code cell.       

🔗 [ChatGPT explanation for the code](https://chatgpt.com/share/67d0e086-ded8-800b-b212-823aaa87f594) 
```python
# Assigning the value 10 to variable 'a'
a = 10

# Assigning the value 5 to variable 'b'
b = 5

# Calculating the sum of 'a' and 'b' and storing it in the variable 'sum'
sum = a + b

# Printing the result of the sum to the screen
print("The sum is:", sum)  
```
3️⃣ Click **Run** (▶) and check the output.     

✅ AI will calculate the sum for you: The sum is 15! 🎉

### 🔹 AI-Powered Interaction 🤖  
### **➕🐍 Add a New Code Cell**          
1️⃣ Click **+ Code** to add another code cell.  
2️⃣ Copy and paste the following code into the new code cell.     
          
🔗 [ChatGPT explanation for the code](https://chatgpt.com/share/67d0e0db-22c8-800b-9caa-470c6045d528)
```python
# Asking the user for their name and storing the input in the variable 'name'
name = input("What’s your name? ")

# Printing a greeting message that includes the user's name
print("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")  
```
3️⃣ Click **Run** (▶) , then type your name in the box that appears and hit Enter
  
✅ AI will greet you with: `Nice to meet you, [Your Name]!   

🎯 **Challenge:** Modify the message or numbers and rerun!
💡 **Extra Tip:** Google Colab allows you to run one code block at a time. If something goes wrong, just re-run the block!
