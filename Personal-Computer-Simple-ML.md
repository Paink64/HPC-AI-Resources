## 🤖 **1. What is a Machine Learning (ML) Model?**  

### **ML = Computers that Learn!** 💡  
A **Machine Learning (ML) model** is a program that **learns from data** to make predictions. Instead of being manually programmed with rules, ML models **find patterns** in data and use them to make future decisions.  

💡 **Where is ML used?**  
- 🛍️ **Amazon & Shopify** → Suggests products based on your shopping history  
- 📺 **Netflix & YouTube** → Recommends movies & videos you might like  
- 📸 **Face Unlock** → Recognizes your face using AI  

💡 **Think:** Can you think of other places you see ML in action? 🤔

## 📈 **2. What is Linear Regression?**  
Linear Regression helps us **find patterns** in data and **make predictions** by drawing a straight line through the data points. 📊  

🔍 **Example:** Imagine tracking students’ ages and their test scores:  
- A **20-year-old** scores **75 points**  
- A **22-year-old** scores **78 points**  
- A **24-year-old** scores **80 points**  

📌 **Pattern:** As **age increases, scores increase**.  
📌 **Linear Regression** finds the best rule (line) to predict new scores.  

### 🎨 **Visual Example:**  
- 🔵 **Dots** = Real student scores from past data  
- 📍📍📍 **Red Line** = The best prediction rule  

📌 **Super Simple Math (No Formulas!):**  
- If each extra year **adds** about **2 points** to the score…  
- Then a **25-year-old** might score **82 points** (based on the pattern).  

💡 **That’s Linear Regression!** 🎉

age_range = np.linspace(18, 30, 100).reshape(-1, 1)  # Reshape to match model input format

# Predict scores for these age values using the trained model
predicted_scores = model.predict(age_range)   

# Create a scatter plot of the actual data (blue dots)
plt.scatter(data['Age'], data['Score'], color='blue', label='Actual Data')

# Draw the prediction line (red) showing how the model predicts scores
plt.plot(age_range, predicted_scores, color='red', label='Prediction Line')

# Label the x-axis as "Age"
plt.xlabel('Age')

# Label the y-axis as "Score"
plt.ylabel('Score')

# Set a title for the graph
