## 🖥️ **3. Understanding Jupyter, CPU & GPUs in HPC**
### **What is a Jupyter Notebook? 📒**  
A Jupyter Notebook is like a smart digital notebook where you can write and run Python code in small sections (cells). Think of it as typing notes and instantly running experiments on a computer! 📝💡  

🔹 **Jupyter = Digital Lab Notebook for AI & Coding!** 🚀

---

### 🖥️ **What is HPC?** ⚡  
High-Performance Computing (HPC) is like a **supercharged computer lab** that can process huge amounts of data and run complex simulations **way faster** than a regular computer. It uses both CPUs (Central Processing Units) and GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) to tackle different types of tasks efficiently.🚀💡  

🔹 **HPC = A Supercomputer for Science & AI!** 🔬⚡

---

### 🌟 **Why HPC?** ⚡  
So, why bother with HPC instead of just using your laptop? HPC is like having a turbo boost for your projects! 🚀 Here’s why it’s awesome:  
- **Speed:** It crunches numbers and runs programs way faster—like finishing a week-long task in an hour! ⚡  
- **Big Problems:** It can handle massive amounts of data, like analyzing every TikTok video ever made 📈 or simulating a rocket launch 🚀.  
- **Teamwork:** HPC uses lots of CPUs and GPUs together, like a superhero team saving the day! 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️  
For high schoolers, HPC means you can experiment with AI, games, or science projects that would crash a regular computer. It’s your secret weapon to explore the impossible! 🌌

---

### 🖥️ **What is a CPU?** ⚡  
A **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is the **brain of a computer**. It handles everyday tasks like running apps, browsing the web, and processing commands **step by step**. 🖥️💡  

🔹 **CPU = The Chef of Your Computer!** 👨‍🍳🧠  

---

  ### 🖥️ What is a GPU? ⚡  

**GPU = A Super-Fast Brain for Your Computer! 🚀**  
A **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)** helps computers work faster by handling many tasks at once. It’s great for AI, gaming, and other powerful computing tasks.  

🎮 **Better Gaming** (e.g., making video games look smooth and realistic)  
🧠 **AI & Machine Learning** (e.g., helping computers recognize faces and objects)  
🎬 **Faster Video Editing** (e.g., making videos load and process quickly)  
🔢 **Solving Big Problems** (e.g., predicting weather or helping doctors find new medicines)  

💡 **Quick Thought:** Where else do you think GPUs are used? Jot down your ideas! 🤔💭  


---

### ⚡ **GPU vs. CPU: What’s the Difference?** 🔍  

Imagine you have a **kitchen** 🍳:  

- A **CPU** is like a **chef** 👨‍🍳 who prepares one meal at a time, carefully following each step.  
- A **GPU** is like a **team of cooks** 👩‍🍳👨‍🍳👨‍🍳 all working together to make many dishes at once!  

| Feature 🛠️  | **CPU (Central Processing Unit) 🖥️** | **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) 🎮** |
|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **What It Does 🎯** | Handles general tasks (running apps, browsing, gaming logic) | Works on many small tasks at once (graphics, AI, video rendering) |
| **How It Works ⚙️** | Focuses on one thing at a time (like a chef) | Does many things at once (like a team of cooks) |
| **Best For ✅** | Opening apps, typing, browsing, gaming | Making cool graphics, AI, and big data tasks |
| **Speed ⚡** | Fast, but does one thing at a time | Super fast for big tasks, but needs more power 🔋 |

### 🚀 **In Short:**  
- **CPUs** are like chefs—great for general work. 🖥️  
- **GPUs** are like a team of cooks—amazing for heavy tasks! 🎮🔬  

🔹 **GPU = Best for AI, graphics, and big projects!** 🚀  
🔹 **CPU = The brain of your computer!** 🖥️

### 🎮 **When Do You Need GPUs & How Many?** 🤔  
GPUs are your go-to when you’re working on **big, parallel tasks** that need tons of power! Here’s when you’d want them and how many you might need:  

- **Small AI Projects (e.g., ChatGPT demos)** 🤖💬
  - If you’re just working with a small AI model (the ones in this workshop), **1 GPU** is enough. 🤖
  - It’s like having one super-strong cook whip up a quick dish! 👩‍🍳🍕 
- **Training Bigger AI Models (e.g., recognizing 1000s of images)** 🖼️
  - For training an AI to spot cats in pics 🐾, you might need **2-4 GPUs**. 
  - More GPUs = faster training, so you’re not waiting all day! ⏩ 
- **Huge Simulations (e.g., weather forecasts or video games)** 🎮
  - For massive projects—like predicting tomorrow’s rain 🌧️ or rendering a next-gen game—you could need **8-16 GPUs** or more! 
  - It’s like a whole kitchen crew working together! 👨‍🍳👩‍🍳👨‍🍳 
- **Scientific research or movie computer-generated imagery (CGI)** 🎞️
  - Think Hollywood effects 🎥 or simulating the universe 🌌—you might use **50-100+ GPUs** in an HPC cluster. That’s a GPU army! 💪  

### **🚨 Warning: Please avoid using the GPU; use the CPU for this task instead. 💻**
